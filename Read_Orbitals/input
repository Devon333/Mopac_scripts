active space for tetracene:38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
ACTIVE SPACE RANGE:39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46
sd basis is written as a vector of strings using the indexing of the active space above starting with zero
each string is a slater determinant the first being the ground state determinant and the others are excited state determinants
Use 1 for some extra output when debugging
